### 📦 1. Data Integrity & Structure

Q: Are there any missing, duplicate, or incorrectly formatted entries in the dataset?  
A:  

Q: Are all data types appropriate (e.g., numeric, categorical)?  
A:  

Q: Did you detect any constant, near-constant, or irrelevant features?  
A:

Q: What is the distribution of `Diabetes_binary`?  
A:  

Q: Is there a class imbalance? If so, how significant is it?  
A:  

Q: How might this imbalance influence your choice of evaluation metrics or model strategy?  
A:

## ✅ Week 2: Feature Engineering & Deep Learning Prep

---

### 🏷️ 1. Categorical Feature Encoding

Q: Which categorical features in the dataset have more than two unique values?  
A:  

Q: Apply integer-encoding to these high-cardinality features. Why is this strategy suitable for a subsequent neural network with an embedding layer?  
A:  

Q: Display the first 5 rows of the transformed data to show the new integer labels.  
A:  

---

### ⚖️ 2. Numerical Feature Scaling

Q: Which numerical features did your EDA from Week 1 suggest would benefit from scaling?  
A:  

Q: Apply a scaling technique to these features. Justify your choice of `StandardScaler` vs. `MinMaxScaler` or another method.  
A:  

Q: Show the summary statistics of the scaled data to confirm the transformation was successful.  
A:  

---

### ✂️ 3. Stratified Data Splitting

Q: Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets (e.g., 70/15/15). What function and parameters did you use?  
A:  

Q: Why is it critical to use stratification for this specific dataset?  
A:  

Q: Verify the stratification by showing the class distribution of `Diabetes_binary` in each of the three resulting sets.  
A:

### 📦 4. Deep Learning Dataset Preparation

Q: Convert your three data splits into PyTorch `DataLoader` or TensorFlow `tf.data.Dataset` objects. What batch size did you choose and why?  
A:  

Q: To confirm they are set up correctly, retrieve one batch from your training loader. What is the shape of the features (X) and labels (y) in this batch?  
A:  

Q: Explain the role of the `shuffle` parameter in your training loader. Why is this setting important for the training set but not for the validation or testing sets?  
A:
