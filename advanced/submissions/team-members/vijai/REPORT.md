### üì¶ 1. Data Integrity & Structure

Q: Are there any missing, duplicate, or incorrectly formatted entries in the dataset?  
A:  

Q: Are all data types a### üìä 3. Visualization & Communication

Q: How did you visualize feature contributions and model explanations for stakeholders?  
A: I created a **horizontal bar chart** showing the top 15 features by gradient importance magnitude, providing clear visual ranking of feature influence. I also implemented **clinical grouping** of features (cardiovascular, metabolic, lifestyle factors) to make results more interpretable for healthcare stakeholders. However, the **very small importance values** (0.0001-0.0006) and **counterintuitive rankings** make these visualizations **difficult to defend** to clinical experts.

Q: What challenges did you encounter when interpreting or presenting model explanations?  
A: Major challenges included: 1) **SHAP incompatibility** forcing use of inferior gradient methods, 2) **Counterintuitive feature rankings** that contradict medical knowledge, 3) **Very small importance values** suggesting weak individual feature signals, 4) **Difficulty explaining** why traditional diabetes indicators ranked low. The **misalignment with domain expertise** makes it challenging to present these findings confidently to healthcare professionals.

Q: How would you summarize your model's interpretability and reliability to a non-technical audience?  
A: **Honest assessment**: "Our diabetes prediction model shows moderate ability to identify potential diabetes cases but has significant limitations. The model's explanations don't align well with medical knowledge - it emphasizes lifestyle factors like alcohol consumption over established risk factors like BMI and age. This suggests the model may be learning from data patterns rather than true medical relationships. **The model is not ready for clinical use** and requires substantial improvement, validation with medical experts, and better explainability tools before deployment consideration."e (e.g., numeric, categorical)?
